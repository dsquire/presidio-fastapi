Analyze the provided Python codebase for adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines and Python best practices. Specifically check for:

1. Code formatting and indentation consistency
2. Variable and function naming conventions (snake_case)
3. Docstring usage and documentation standards
4. Import organization and management
5. Function length and complexity
6. Exception handling practices
7. Type hints and annotations
8. Comments clarity and necessity
9. Module-level organization
10. Test coverage and quality

Apply Pythonic principles including:
- List/dictionary comprehensions where appropriate
- Context managers for resource handling
- Generator expressions for memory efficiency
- Built-in functions and standard library solutions
- EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) approach

Highlight any violations of DRY, SOLID, or clean code principles. Provide specific recommendations for improvements, focusing on readability, maintainability, and performance.
